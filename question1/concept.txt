This question can be done even without code.
Sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 from 1 to 1000 is sum of two arithmetic progression
1) 3,6,9,...999
2) 5,10,15,...995
but here numbers like 15,30... are repeating which again are A.P. of 15 multiples.
so sum of all multiples will be 
S3 + S5 - S15
But we are practicing coding so to do it with code
we will have to find all numbers from 1 to 1000 which are divisible from 3 or 5
Algorithm:
1) iterate from i=1 to less than 1000
2) if i%3=0 OR i%5=0 then sum=sum+i
3) print sum
